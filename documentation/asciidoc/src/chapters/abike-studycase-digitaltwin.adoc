== Autonomous A-Bike Case Study

=== New Features

The following new features have been introduced in the extension of the EBike case study, featuring the autonomous e-bike ("a-bike") for smart city environments:

- The a-bike can autonomously reach the nearest station after being used.
- The a-bike can autonomously reach a user who requests the service.

Also, it was needed that the a-bike and the elements of the smart city (e.g., stations) would be available as Digital Twins.

=== Requirements

We report here only the Domain-Driven-Design parts that are new compared to the original EBike case study.

1. The system must allow users to request an autonomous a-bike to reach their location.
2. The system must allow users to view the real-time position and status of a-bikes.
3. The system must allow a-bikes to autonomously return to the nearest station after use.
4. The system must allow operators to monitor all a-bikes and stations in real time via Digital Twin.
5. The system must allow operators to view the operational status and real-time position of a-bikes on a map.

==== Bounded Contexts
In addition to the original EBike case study, a new bounded context is introduced for the autonomous a-bike:

- Autonomous A-Bike Context: This context handles the management of A-Bikes and Stations.

Initially, it was considered to extend the original EBike context to include the autonomous a-bike. However, it was decided to create a new bounded context to better encapsulate the new features and requirements. This separation is also expected to be beneficial for the future development of a more complex smart city system.

Stations are also included in this new context, as they are essential and closely related to the operations of the autonomous a-bikes.

=== Implementation
Only non-trivial implementation details are reported here.

==== New Microservices
It was decided to create a new microservice for the autonomous a-bike, that manages the autonomous a-bike and the stations. The new microservice is called `abike-microservice`.

It follows the same architecture of the other microservices, using hexagonal architecture and an Event-Driven approach.

==== Detailed Microservice Structure
For explaining the structure of microservices, i'll detail the `abike-microservice`.

The `abike-microservice` follows the **Hexagonal Architecture** pattern, which provides a clean separation between the business logic and external concerns. This architecture ensures that the domain logic remains independent of frameworks, databases, and external services.

===== Architecture Overview

The hexagonal architecture organizes the codebase into three main layers:

1. **Domain Layer (Core)**: Contains the pure business logic and domain models
2. **Application Layer**: Orchestrates use cases and coordinates between domain and infrastructure
3. **Infrastructure Layer**: Handles external concerns like databases, message brokers, and external APIs

===== Domain Layer

[plantuml, {diagramsdir}/abike-domain-uml, svg, title="Domain Layer UML of ABike Microservice", width=75%]
----
!include resources/puml/abike-domain-uml.puml
----

The **Domain Layer** represents the core business logic and is completely independent of external frameworks or technologies. It contains:

- **Domain Models**: Pure business entities like `ABike` and `Station` with their business rules
- **Value Objects**: Immutable objects like `P2d` for coordinates and enums like `ABikeState`, `BikeType`
- **Factories**: `ABikeFactory` and `StationFactory` for creating domain entities with proper validation
- **Mappers**: `ABikeMapper` and `StationMapper` for converting between domain models and external representations

[source,java]
----
// Domain model example
public class ABike implements Aggregate<String> {
    private final String id;
    private final ABikeState state;
    private final P2d location;
    private final int batteryLevel;
    private final BikeType type;
    // Pure business logic methods
}
----

The domain models are **immutable** and contain only business logic. They don't know about databases, JSON, or external systems.

===== Application Layer

[plantuml, {diagramsdir}/abike-application-uml, svg, title="Application Layer UML of ABike Microservice", width=95%]
----
!include resources/puml/abike-application-uml.puml
----

The **Application Layer** orchestrates the business use cases and acts as a bridge between the domain and infrastructure layers. It contains:

- **Service Implementations**: `ABikeServiceImpl` coordinates domain operations and external communications
- **Port Interfaces**: Define contracts for external dependencies
  - **Inbound Ports**: `ABikeServiceAPI` - interfaces that the application exposes
  - **Outbound Ports**: `ABikeRepository`, `BikeCommunicationPort`, `StationServiceAPI` - interfaces for external dependencies

[source,java]
----
// Application service coordinating domain and infrastructure
public class ABikeServiceImpl implements ABikeServiceAPI {
    private final ABikeRepository repository;           // Outbound port
    private final BikeCommunicationPort communicationPort; // Outbound port
    private final StationServiceAPI stationService;     // Outbound port
    
    public CompletableFuture<ABike> createABike(String bikeId) {
        // Orchestrates domain creation and persistence
        ABike abike = ABikeFactory.getInstance().create(...);
        communicationPort.sendUpdate(abike);  // Uses domain model
        return repository.save(abike);        // Uses domain model
    }
}
----

The application layer works exclusively with **domain models** internally, using mappers only at the boundaries when communicating with external systems.

===== Infrastructure Layer

[plantuml, {diagramsdir}/abike-infrastructure-uml, svg, title="Infrastructure Layer UML of ABike Microservice", width=70%]
----
!include resources/puml/abike-infrastructure-uml.puml
----

The **Infrastructure Layer** contains all the technical implementations and external integrations. It's divided into:

**Inbound Adapters** (receive data from external sources):

- **REST Controllers**: Handle HTTP requests and convert them to domain operations
- **Message Consumers**: `RideCommunicationAdapter` consumes Kafka messages and converts JSON to domain models before calling application services

[source,java]
----
// Inbound adapter handling external messages
private void processABikeRideUpdate(JsonObject updateJson) {
    ABike aBike = ABikeMapper.fromJson(updateJson);  // Convert to domain
    aBikeService.updateABike(aBike);                 // Use domain model
}
----

**Outbound Adapters** (send data to external systems):

- **Repository Implementations**: Handle persistence using the database technology
- **Message Producers**: `BikeCommunicationAdapter` converts domain models to JSON before sending to Kafka

[source,java]
----
// Outbound adapter sending data externally
public void sendUpdate(ABike abike) {
    JsonObject json = ABikeMapper.toJson(abike);     // Convert from domain
    producer.send(new ProducerRecord<>(topic, json.encode()));
}
----


===== Data Flow and Mapping Strategy

The architecture ensures a clear **data transformation flow**:

1. **External → Domain**: Inbound adapters convert external formats (JSON, HTTP requests) to domain models using mappers
2. **Domain Processing**: Application services work exclusively with domain models
3. **Domain → External**: Outbound adapters convert domain models back to external formats

This mapping strategy provides several benefits:

- **Domain Purity**: Business logic is not polluted with external format concerns
- **Flexibility**: External formats can change without affecting domain logic
- **Testability**: Domain logic can be tested independently of external systems
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns makes the codebase easier to understand and modify

The hexagonal architecture ensures that the domain remains the stable core while external technologies can be easily replaced or modified without affecting the business logic.

==== Event Data Definition
In this project, we use Avro to define the data structure of the events exchanged between microservices. 

For example, the following Avro schema defines the structure of a bike action update event:

[source,avro]
----
{
  "type": "record",
  "name": "BikeActionUpdate",
  "namespace": "domain.events",
  "fields": [
    {"name": "username", "type": ["null", "string"], "default": null},
    {"name": "bikeName", "type": "string"},
    {"name": "bikeType", "type": "string"},
    {"name": "action", "type": "string"}
  ]
}
----

All the topics uses Avro schemas to ensure a consistent data structure across the system, made exception for the topics related to the Digital Twin, which uses JSON payloads, to allow easier communication with the Eclipse Ditto platform.

Avro also enforces type safety in the code. For example, in the Kafka consumer adapter, the type of the consumed message is statically checked:

[source,java]
----
// Only BikeRideUpdate Avro records can be consumed here
KafkaConsumer<String, BikeRideUpdate> avroConsumer =
    new KafkaConsumer<>(kafkaProperties.getAvroConsumerProperties());
avroConsumer.subscribe(List.of("abike-ride-update"));

while (running.get()) {
    ConsumerRecords<String, BikeRideUpdate> records = avroConsumer.poll(Duration.ofMillis(100));
    for (ConsumerRecord<String, BikeRideUpdate> record : records) {
        BikeRideUpdate update = record.value(); // update is type-safe, matches Avro schema
        // ...process update...
    }
}
----

This ensures that only messages conforming to the Avro schema are processed, reducing runtime errors due to unexpected data types.

Similarly, Avro enforces type safety on the producer side. For example, when sending an update, only objects matching the Avro schema can be sent:

[source,java]
----
// Only EBikeUpdate Avro records can be sent here
Producer<String, EBikeUpdate> producer =
    new KafkaProducer<>(kafkaProperties.getProducerProperties());
EBikeUpdate avroUpdate = EBikeMapper.toAvro(ebike); // type-safe conversion
producer.send(new ProducerRecord<>(topicName, ebike.getId(), avroUpdate));
----

This guarantees that only Avro-encoded messages matching the schema are produced, preventing accidental schema mismatches at compile time.

==== New Communication Flow and Topics

Here we describe the new topics and communication flows introduced in the autonomous a-bike case study.
It was decided to duplicate some topics, even though it would have been possible to use the same topics as those used for E-Bikes. However, having separate topics for the autonomous a-bike was considered more appropriate to avoid confusion and to better support future extensions of the smart city system.

===== Detailed Communication Patterns

===== 1. ABike State Update
- **Producer:** abike-microservice (_BikeCommunicationAdapter_)
- **Topic:** abike-updates
- **Consumers:** map-microservice (_BikeUpdateAdapter_), ride-microservice (_BikeConsumerAdapter_)
- **Flow:** When an ABike's state or position changes, the abike-microservice publishes this update to the abike-updates topic. The map service consumes this message to update the bike's position on the map via websocket, while the ride service updates its local repository of available ABikes.

===== 2. Station State Update
- **Producer:** abike-microservice (_StationCommunicationAdapter_)
- **Topic:** station-updates
- **Consumers:** map-microservice (_StationUpdateAdapter_), ride-microservice (_StationConsumerAdapter_)
- **Flow:** When a station's data changes, the abike-microservice publishes an update to the station-updates topic. The map service consumes this to update the station's view via websocket, and the ride service consumes it to keep its local station repository synchronized.

===== 3. Ride Events Affecting ABike
- **Producer:** ride-microservice (_BikeCommunicationAdapter_)
- **Topic:** abike-ride-update
- **Consumer:** abike-microservice (_RideCommunicationAdapter_)
- **Flow:** When the ride-microservice processes a ride event involving an ABike (e.g., start/end ride), it publishes an update to the abike-ride-update topic. The abike-microservice consumes this message to update the ABike's state accordingly (e.g., from AVAILABLE to IN_USE).

===== 4. Bike Dispatch Notifications
- **Producer:** ride-microservice (_UserCommunicationAdapter_)
- **Topic:** ride-bike-dispatch
- **Consumer:** user-microservice (_RideConsumerAdapter_)
- **Flow:** When the ride-microservice processes a dispatch request (e.g., sending an autonomous bike to a user), it publishes a message to the ride-bike-dispatch topic. The user-microservice consumes this message and forwards it to the specific user's client via a real-time websocket.

=== Digital Twin

For the Digital Twin, it was decided to use Eclipse Ditto, which is a powerful platform for managing Digital Twins. 

The platform is setupped to listen to the Kafka topics related to the a-bike and stations, and it automatically updates the Digital Twin representation of the a-bike and stations in real time, using a JavaScript payload mapper.

==== Connection Setup and Docker Integration

The digital twin implementation uses Eclipse Ditto connected to the Kafka message broker to synchronize real-time data from the microservices. The connection is established through Ditto's connectivity service, which is deployed via Docker and shares the same network (`kafka-ditto-net`) as the Kafka broker to enable communication.

The Kafka broker is configured to be accessible from both the microservices network and the Ditto network:

[source,yaml]
----
kafka-broker:
  networks:
    - eureka-network
    - kafka-ditto-net
----

==== Kafka Topics Consumption

The Ditto connection listens to two main Kafka topics that provide real-time updates about the autonomous bike-sharing system:

- **`abike-update`**: Receives updates about individual autonomous a-bikes
- **`station-update`**: Receives updates about stations

The connection configuration specifies these topics as source addresses:

[source,json]
----
"sources": [
  {
    "addresses": [
      "abike-update",
      "station-update"
    ],
    "consumerCount": 1,
    "payloadMapping": ["JavaScript"]
  }
]
----

==== Data Transformation with JavaScript Mapper

The connection uses a JavaScript mapper to transform incoming Kafka messages into Ditto protocol messages. The mapper handles both bike and station updates by creating appropriate thing IDs and feature structures:

[source,javascript]
----
function mapToDittoProtocolMsg(headers, textPayload, bytePayload, contentType) {
    var topic = headers["kafka.topic"] || "";
    let thingId;
    if (topic === "abike-update") {
        thingId = "abike:" + jsonData.id;
    } else if( topic === "station-update") {
        thingId = "station:" + jsonData.id;
    }
    
    // Transform properties into Ditto features
    var features = {};
    for (var key in jsonData) {
        if (jsonData.hasOwnProperty(key) && key !== 'id') {
            features[key] = {
                properties: {
                    value: jsonData[key]
                }
            };
        }
    }
    // Create Ditto protocol message...
}
----

This mapper creates digital twin representations where each bike becomes a "thing" with the ID format `abike:{bikeId}` and each station becomes `station:{stationId}`. All properties from the Kafka message (except the ID) are transformed into Ditto features with nested property structures.

The real-time synchronization ensures that the digital twin always reflects the current state of the physical bike-sharing system, enabling operators to monitor fleet status, track bike locations, and manage station capacity through the digital twin interface.
