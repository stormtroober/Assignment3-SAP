=== Introduction to Event Sourcing
==== Concepts and Principles

Event sourcing is an architectural pattern that stores changes to application state as a sequence of events. This approach enables accurate reconstruction of past states and provides a complete audit trail.

Kafka serves as an excellent platform for implementing event sourcing due to its distributed nature and durability guarantees.
