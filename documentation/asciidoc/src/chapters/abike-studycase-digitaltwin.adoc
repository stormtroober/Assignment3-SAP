== Autonomous A-Bike Case Study

=== New Features

The following new features have been introduced in the extension of the EBike case study, featuring the autonomous e-bike ("a-bike") for smart city environments:

- The a-bike can autonomously reach the nearest station after being used.
- The a-bike can autonomously reach a user who requests the service.

Also, it was needed that the a-bike and the elements of the smart city (e.g., stations) would be available as Digital Twins.
