== ABike Study Case and Digital Twin

=== Digital Twin Concept
==== Overview and Benefits

A digital twin is a virtual representation of a physical object or system. In the context of ABike, digital twins enable real-time monitoring, analysis, and optimization of bike-sharing operations.

=== Implementation Architecture

Digital twins for bike-sharing systems capture various dimensions:

* Physical state (location, condition)
* Usage patterns
* Maintenance requirements
** Predictive maintenance
** Service history

* Physical state (location, condition)
* Usage patterns
* Maintenance requirements
